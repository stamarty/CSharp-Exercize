When consuming any remote resources, whether an FTP site or an HTTP web service, you cannot guarantee that the resource is online and listening for your request. 
Microsoft, 20483B Programming in Visual C#, ch. 10, p. 1405.

...you should enclose any logic that communicates with a remote data source in a try/catch statement, with the catch block handling exceptions of type WebException.
