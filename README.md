# CSharp-Exercize

C# Practice from Cracking the Coding Interview or LeetCode. Maybe from some other random locations too.

- **cci_ReverseString** - reverses a string entered as a parameter. There are two method signatures in the class, one returns the string reversed, the other writes the string reversed to console.

- **lc_ToLower** - Takes a string as a parameter and returns the same string all in lowercase.
there's a method using the built in method **ToLower();** as well as a method I built taking the ascii value of the character and 
adding 32 if it is capitalized. This second method, **ToLowerCaseSB;**, uses **StringBuilder**.
