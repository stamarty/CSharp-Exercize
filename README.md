# CSharp-Exercize

C# Practice from *Cracking the Coding Interview*, *LeetCode* and *HackerRank*. Maybe from some other random locations too.

Each of classes are named after the program they contain. Select all code in the Program class and uncomment once. That should run your program with the samples built in.  Do not forget to recomment them or you'll start breaking the rest of the programs.

- **hr_CompareTheTriplets** - Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale from 1 to 100 for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and difficulty. We define the rating for Alice's challenge to be the 'a' triplet, and the rating for Bob's challenge to be the 'b' triplet. Your task is to find their comparison points by comparing a[0] with b[0], a[1] with b[1] , and a[2] with b[2].
    - If a[i] > b[i], then Alice is awarded  point.
    - If a[i] < b[i],, then Bob is awarded  point.
    - If a[i] == b[i],, then neither person receives a point.

- **allDigits** - Takes a string as a parameter and checks if the string consists of all digits or not. Does not use built in method. This problem was presented by Microsoft Technical Mentor.

- **lc_DefangIP** - Takes a valid IPv4 address and replaces "." with "[.]".

- **lc_JewelsAndStones** - Check contents of string J against contents of string S. Returns number of times elements of J appear in elements of S.

- **cci_ReverseString** - reverses a string entered as a parameter. There are two method signatures in the class, one returns the string reversed, the other writes the string reversed to console.

- **hr_SimpleArraySum** - Given an array of integers, find the sum of its elements.

- **lc_ToLower** - Takes a string as a parameter and returns the same string all in lowercase. There's a method using the built in method **ToLower();** as well as a method I built taking the ascii value of the character and adding 32 if it is capitalized. This second method, **ToLowerCaseSB;**, uses **StringBuilder**.

- **lc_TwoSum** - Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

- **Module6Files** - Various methods to manipulate files using **C#**.
