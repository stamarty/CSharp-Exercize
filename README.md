# CSharp-Exercize

C# Practice from Cracking the Coding Interview or LeetCode. Maybe from some other randome locations too.

- **cci_ReverseString** - reverses a string entered as a parameter. There are two method signatures in the class, one returns the string reversed, the other writes the string reversed to console.

- **lc_ToLower** - Takes a string as a parameter and returns the same string all in lowercase. The class currently uses the build in method **ToLower()**. I can (and should) probably write the class to loop through the string and convert the char.
